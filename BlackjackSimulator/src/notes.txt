- GUI handles displaying cards and giving them letters currently XXX BAAAD
- Need to create dealer class to have an list of hands. pass in second card as hidden.
- Might need to add insurance if dealers first card is an ace. Apparently this is an important part of 
	blackjack strategy for card counters when the 10's are dense. It's half the original bet for insurance, 
	then it pays double what you've paid in total. Bet $10, get $5 insurance, dealer gets blackjack, you 
	receive $30.
- Need starting screen to select num decks, starting money, & min bet.
