- Add checkbox to toggle hide/show true/running count;

- Finalize layout:
	- Add more style to buttons
	- Add 4 buttons next to deal. 1/2x, 2x, 3x, 4x
		- 1/2x, 2x, 3x, 4x should just multiply the current custom bet

	- Add slider that changes custom bet input amount (still allow typing in custom bet)
		- loweset they can slide to is min bet. max is all the money they have, reset this after each round
		- the slide increments by the min bet (ie 25->50->75)
		- look at the screenshot for idea.

	- Add buttons in the side bet pop up to quickly select values, clicking the button will add the money, so you could hit $1 twice to get $2
		- remove(0), $1, $5, $10, $25

	- Move money to be underneath the betting section
	
- Implement training mode with a checkbox toggle to enable/disable.
	- If you make an unoptimal play, it will pop up telling you:
		- The play you made was unoptimal. It will explain why.
		- It will tell you the best play to make.
		- It will have 2 buttons, one that lets you continue with your unoptimal play and one that changes your input to the optimal play

- Add audio effects ?
